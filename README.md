# üéÆ Python Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Python. It allows a single player to play against a computer opponent.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Player vs. Computer:** Play a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a simple computer opponent.
* **Dynamic Board Display:** The game board is visually updated with clear spacing, showing player moves and available positions.
* **Win/Loss/Tie Detection:** The game accurately identifies and declares a winner or a tie.
* **Input Validation:** The game handles invalid and out-of-bounds inputs to ensure smooth gameplay.

## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```
3.  **Run the game:**
    ```
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your moves.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Explanation

The game is structured with several functions to handle different parts of the gameplay:

* `printboard()`: This function is responsible for rendering the game board in the console. It dynamically displays `*` and `o` for played positions and the numbers `1-9` for available spots.
* `chkWin()`: This function checks the state of the board after each move. It determines if a player has achieved a winning combination or if the game has ended in a tie. It returns a status code to signal the result.
* `play_game()`: This is the main function that manages the game loop. It handles player turns, takes input, updates the board, and calls `chkWin()` to check the game's status. It also contains the logic for the computer's turn, which currently makes a random move.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

One popular and interesting enhancement for a game like this is to make the computer unbeatable. This can be achieved by using an advanced algorithm like **MiniMax**. This type of algorithm allows the computer to "think ahead" by evaluating all possible moves and choosing the one that guarantees the best outcome for itself, assuming the other player also plays perfectly.
